Of one that loved not wisely but too well
Misery acquaints a man with strange bed-fellows
What's in a name?  That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.
Two households, both alike in dignity, In fair Verona, where we lay our scene
Sit you down, father; rest you
Better a witty fool than a foolish wit
Be not afraid of greatness. some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon 'em
All the world's a stage, And all the men and women merely players; They have their exits and their entrances; And one man in his time plays many parts
Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player That struts and frets his hour upon the stage And then is heard no more. It is a tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing.
Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves that we are underlings
There is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so
How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have a thankless child!
To be, or not to be- that is the question
Neither a borrower nor a lender be
This above all- to thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man
Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears
But for mine own part, it was Greek to me
The course of true love never did run smooth
Now is the winter of our discontent
A man can die but once
Frailty, thy name is woman
The lady doth protest too much, methinks
Beware the Ides of March
Get thee to a nunnery
If music be the food of love, play on
The better part of valour is discretion
All that glisters is not gold
Lord, what fools these mortals be!
A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!
The evil that men do lives after them, The good is oft interred with their bones
Off with his head!
Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown
This is very midsummer madness
I cannot tell what the dickens his name is
Brevity is the soul of wit
What light through yonder window breaks
