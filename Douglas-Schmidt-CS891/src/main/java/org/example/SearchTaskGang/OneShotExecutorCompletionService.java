 * @brief Customizes the SearchTaskGangCommon framework to process a
 *        one-shot List of tasks via a variable-sized pool of Threads
 *        created by the ExecutorService. The units of concurrency are
 *        a "task per search word" *and* the input Strings. The
 *        results processing model uses an Asynchronous Future model,
 *        which starts processing results immediately.
