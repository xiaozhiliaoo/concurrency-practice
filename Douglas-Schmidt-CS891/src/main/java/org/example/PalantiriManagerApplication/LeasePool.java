 * Thread that acquired it has released it, this Thread will be sent
 * an interrupt request that will cause it to receive the
 * InterruptedException so it can release the lease.
 *
 * This class implements a variant of the "Pooling" pattern
 * (kircher-schwanninger.de/michael/publications/Pooling.pdf).  It
 * plays the role of the "Abstraction" in the GoF Bridge and uses the
 * Strategy pattern to configure the type of synchronization mechanism
 * used to protect internal state from race conditions.
