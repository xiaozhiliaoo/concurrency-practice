Design -> Analysis -> Development

[Design] Choose among relevant design strategies to approach problems; construct and use components that apply atomicity, asynchrony, and coordination techniques for correct and efficient operation.
[Analysis] Determine safety, liveness, and parallel speedup properties; recognize sequential vs parallel constructions; empirically evaluate multiple solutions to a given problem.
[Development] Incorporate covered techniques in concurrent and parallel applications.
