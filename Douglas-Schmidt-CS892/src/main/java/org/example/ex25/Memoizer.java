/**
 * This class defines a "memoizing" cache that synchronously maps a
 * key to the value produced by a {@code function} argument passed to
 * the constructor.  If a value has previously been computed it is
 * returned rather than calling the function to compute it again.  The
 * Java Map computeIfAbsent() method is used to ensure only a single
 * call to the function is run when a key and value is first added to
 * the cache.
 *
 * The {@code map} argumented passed to the constructor determines
 * what implementation of {@code Map} is used for the cache.
 * Implementations include {@code ConcurrentHashMap} (which is correct
 * and efficient in a concurrent program), {@code SynchronizedMap}
 * (which is correct, but inefficient in a concurrent program), and
 * {@code HashMap} (which is incorrect in a concurrent program).
 *
 * This code is based on an example in "Java Concurrency in Practice"
 * by Brian Goetz et al.  More information on memoization is available
 * at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization.
