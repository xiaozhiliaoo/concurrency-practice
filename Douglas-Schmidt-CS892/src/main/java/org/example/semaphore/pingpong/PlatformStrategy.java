 *        synchronizing on Thread completion in the ping/pong
 *        application.  This class is a singleton that also plays the
 *        role of the "Strategy" in the Strategy pattern and the
 *        Product in the Factory Method pattern.  Both the
 *        PlatformStrategyConsole and PlatformStrategyAndroid
 *        subclasses extend this class.
